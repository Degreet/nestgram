# What is Nestgram?

Nestgram - Framework for working with Telegram Bot API on TypeScript like Nest.js

# Guide

You can read the [guide on the official Nestgram website](https://degreetpro.gitbook.io/nestgram/getting-started/guide), on [Medium website](https://medium.com/p/ff251fb825fd) or here

## Install Nestgram

You need to install nestgram at first. You can do this using yarn or npm.

```nginx
yarn add nestgram
// or
npm i nestgram
```

## Create main file

Our next step is creating the main file, so let's create the `main.ts` file

```typescript
import { NestGram } from 'nestgram';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

async function bootstrap(): Promise<void> {
  const bot = new NestGram('TOKEN', AppModule);
  await bot.start();
}

bootstrap();
```

At first, we imported nestgram and our AppModule, later we will create it. In the next step, we created a bootstrap function, in which we set up and run the project. The NestGram class gets bot token as 1st parameter (you can get it via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)), app module as 2nd parameter, options as 3rd parameter, and [run config](https://degreetpro.gitbook.io/nestgram/advenced/webhooks-and-run-config) as 4th parameter

## Create app.module.ts

Let's create the `app.module.ts` file. In it, we will describe all available controllers and services.

```typescript
import { Module } from 'nestgram';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [AppController],
  services: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

At first, we imported Module class from nestgram, AppController and AppService also, that we will create later. Then we described our controllers and services in @Module decorator.

## Create app.controller.ts

Let's create the `app.controller.ts` file. In it, we will describe updates, that we want to handle.

```typescript
import { OnCommand, Controller } from 'nestgram';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService?: AppService) {}

  @OnCommand('start')
  start(): string {
    return 'Hello, world!';
  }
}
```

We have created a controller where we describe an update when the user writes /start, and we handle it by sending a message "Hello, world!".

## Create app.service.ts

Let's create the `app.service.ts` file. In it, we will describe methods with working with db, that we will call in controller.

```typescript
import { Service } from 'nestgram';

@Service()
export class AppService {}
```

We can describe methods in AppService class, and call it in controller by this.appService.

## Run project

To run the project, open a terminal in the project directory and type:

```nginx
npm run dev
```

Or build and run production:

```nginx
npm run build && npm run prod
```

Now you know about the syntax and structure of the Nestgram project, but if you want to write your own pro bot, you can check out the [Nestgram documentation](https://degreetpro.gitbook.io/nestgram/)
